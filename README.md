# twitter-bot
A basic javascript twitter bot that wishes people to have a great day. Very basic, but this provides the framework for building a more advanced bot! 

Run the bot on a node with node.js. The twit package makes everything easier and will be required. You can find [documentation here.](https://www.npmjs.com/package/twit)
